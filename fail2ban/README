The images containing "geoip" take two environment variables: USER and LICENSE. 
They are MaxMind credentials that can be provided as environemnt variables, secrets, etc.
USER might look like 9056940, and is generated along with your MaxMind account.
LICENSE might look like LwjhjiTODTdN40Qv, and has to be created in the Web UI.

Each respective IP will be sent to MaxMind. An option to download the entire DB and 
update it periodically is possible, but not currently built with these Containerfiles.
